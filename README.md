Turn-Based Combat Game - Student Project
This project is a simple yet engaging turn-based game developed using Python as part of my computer science coursework.

Gameplay Overview
At the start of the game, players choose their character and an opponent to face. Each character begins with:

A set of unique skills
Three recovery potions
An initial HP (Health Points) value
Game Mechanics
During their turn, players can choose one of the following actions:

Attack: Use a skill to damage the opponent.
Use a Recovery Potion: Restore HP to stay in the game.
Save the Game: Save progress to resume later.
Quit: Exit the game.
Once the player's turn ends, the opponent takes its turn. The opponent's actions are randomly decided by the program, simulating an unpredictable AI behavior.

Win/Loss Conditions
Victory: The opponent's HP is reduced to zero or below.
Defeat: The player's HP drops to zero or below.
The project incorporates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input handling, and randomization, showcasing both technical proficiency and creativity in game development.
