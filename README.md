# Mystofia-Game
A game I made as a student for my computer science project. It is a simple turn based game using Python language.
First you choose the character you want to play and select your opponent.
The game begins with your character having three recovery potions and a set of unique skills.
During your turn,you can choose to attack,use a recovery potion,save the game,or quit.
Once your turn ends,the opponent takes its turn,with the program randomly deciding its action.
You win if the opponent's HP drops to zero or below, and you lose if your HP does the same.
